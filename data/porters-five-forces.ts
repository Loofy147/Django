      2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers: How much power do suppliers have over pricing?
      3. Bargaining Power of Buyers: How much power do customers have over pricing?
      4. Threat of Substitute Products: How easily can customers switch to alternatives?
      5. Competitive Rivalry: How intense is competition among existing players?
