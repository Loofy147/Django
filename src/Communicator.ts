**Key Financial Ratios to Monitor:**

**Liquidity Ratios:**
- Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities (Target: 1.5-3.0)
- Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities (Target: 1.0+)

**Profitability Ratios:**
- ROE = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity (Target: 15%+)
- ROA = Net Income / Total Assets (Target: 5%+)
- Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue (Industry dependent)

**Leverage Ratios:**
- Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt / Total Equity (Target: <1.0 for most industries)
- Interest Coverage = EBITDA / Interest Expense (Target: 3.0+)

**Efficiency Ratios:**
- Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Total Assets
- Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory

**Analysis Framework:**
1. Compare ratios to industry benchmarks
2. Analyze trends over 3-5 years
3. Consider economic and industry cycles
4. Evaluate management quality and strategy
5. Assess competitive position

Remember: Financial ratios are tools for analysis, not absolute measures of success.`
